        <h1>about <span class="about"></span></h1><p>Hello World, my name is Tyland Sheard. I am from Indianapolis, Indiana. I have a passion for code and also a passion for tacos. I love sports and of course video games. I bring a creative and energetic presence. I Enjoy creating beautiful and responsive web/mobile applications. I like to think outside of the box and also supporting others. I enjoy being the person people can lean on for help with debugging, coming up with a creative idea, or whatever the case may be. It brings me great joy to see things you work so hard on behind the scenes come to life within your application.</p>
